Ruby Sample #1

Without using any built in date or time functions, write a function or method that 
accepts two mandatory arguments. The first argument is a string of the format 
"[H]H:MM {AM|PM}" and the second argument is an integer. 
Assume the integer is the number of minutes to add to the string. 
The return value of the function should be a string of the same format as the first argument.  
For example AddMinutes ("9:13 AM", 10) would return "9:23 AM".
